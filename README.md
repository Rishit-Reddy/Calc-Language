Sure! Here's a very simple `README.md` file for your project:

```markdown
# Calc Language

A simple arithmetic expression evaluator written in Python.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd calc-lang
    ```

2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script with an arithmetic expression as an argument:
```bash
python main.py "3 + 5 * (10 - 4)"
```

## Files

- `lexer.py`: Contains the lexer for tokenizing the input.
- `syntax_analyzer.py`: Contains the parser for generating the AST.
- `interpreter.py`: Contains the interpreter for evaluating the AST.
- `main.py`: Entry point for running the interpreter from the command line.

## Example

```bash
python main.py "3 + 5 * (2 - 8)"
```

This will output the result of the expression.
```

This simple `README.md` provides basic instructions on how to install, use, and understand the project structure. You can replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
